# Tailwind CSS project - Ahmed Amer

This is a project made with just a few lines of HTML and Tailwind CSS. It is a landing page for a mock fashion website.

Features include cards in the main section, circular logo attached in between the header and main, and a free-flowing responsive design with a basic pinkish color theme.

Play around with the size of the screen to see all the different sizes and shapes that occur with responsiveness.

Note the index.css file is just to access a couple of root color variable for the chosen theme.
